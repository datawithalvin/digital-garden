# Alvin Noza
### Data Viz. Machine Learning. 

I enjoy solving problems with data and have experience in numerous aspects of data work, from descriptive analytics to predictive modeling. I use various machine learning approaches to meet clients' needs, drawing from my experience in data consultancy.

My current work typically involves collaborating with clients in financial services, such as banks or multifinance companies. In collaboration with these entities, I build churn prediction models, develop credit scorecards, and create recommendations for cross-selling/up-selling strategies.

Feel free to connect with or contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvin-n-802a65226/). I am open to collaboration or freelance work.
